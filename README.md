*The robot can hide from gunshots or mummies by slipping in bewteen the pillars. Mummies will follow you if you get too close or are seen by them. If you hide they will go back to one of a few default positions. Use the gun, the hiding place or risk trying to jump over the mummie.

*Stairs are recessed into the scene and you must use W to move into position to use them. 

There are walls with low openings that are too short for the robot to get under. To get passed these the robot will need to sprint and slide underneath them. If you do not make it you will be warped to a safe place. Some doors (activated by buttons) are on timers and will benifit from sliding underneath them.

Swarms of bugs also will hinder your progress by making you take a longer route or risking being distroyed by running through them.

**The arm must be the item in use to pickup anything.
**The drill is used for small white walls (these walls are roughtly the size of the robot).
